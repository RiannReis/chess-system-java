## What I learned:
1. **OOP Topics (in general)**
* Encapsulation
* Associations
* Constructors
* Inheritance
* Overriding
* Polymorphism
* Enumerations
* Exceptions

### Layers pattern
Use the layering pattern to understand how game logic and game composition work. In addition to organizing the project with this pattern and understanding how to apply it.

2. **Data Structures**
* Matrix
* List

3. Git
* How Git/ GitHub works, how to use it, and I'm also reading the Pro Git book and intend to use it to delve deeper into it and use it for future reference and further learning.
